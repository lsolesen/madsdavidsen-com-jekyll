  Hi Mads,

  Interesting to read you posts. Regarding possession, isn't it true that possession is heavily influence by the score in the match? For example, while team A might have had 55% possession for the whole match, it might have been 50/50 when the score was tied and 65/35 when team A was trailing the match.

  So, with that in mind, I think that particularly the 3rd round of games have to be treated with care. In a lot of those games one of the teams were effectively ahead when the game kicked off (Italy-Uruguay is an example), or the one of the teams had already progressed or been knocked out, and therefore experimenting with lineup/strategy.

  Of course there's an issue about recovery, but which would be preferred if your 2nd game is Saturday in Rio: That your previous game was Monday in Manaus, or Tuesday in Porto Alegre? In Manaus you get the heat, but an extra days rest.

  Best Regards,
