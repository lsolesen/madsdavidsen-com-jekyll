  In order to make significant improvements, China needs a systematic overhaul in its football organization, starting from the very grassroot level to the very top CFA.  We need to get the machine fixed before it can produce good quality products (good players and good teams).

  That said, I want to congratulate you on the excellent column articles you've brought us in the past year(it's probably not necessary for me to nag you how well these were received by the Chinese fans, as you are already nicknamed "dong-qiu-dee").  I'd just express my best wishes to the success of your coaching-scouting-freelancing career in China, and I look forward to your game analysis conducted in Chinese some day (trust me, it will happen!)
