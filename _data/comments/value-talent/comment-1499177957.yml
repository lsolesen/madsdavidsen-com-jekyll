  I think of football as a type of education.

  I also think in football, individual skills has two aspects -  tricks, and improvisation, tricks being a player's go-to skills when situations fits. A player's performance can be a simple add-up of his tricks, and his improvisation.

  Elkeson, for example, seems to play mostly on improvisation. He reacts and improvises all the time on his next moves. He is very talented, which is why he is effective.

  Hulk, on the other hand, has very obvious tricks, he can make powerful long shots in front of the goal. So when defenses are down, and he is close to the middle of the court, he go for this trick, he does it smoothly and efficiently. I'm not saying that Hulk doesn't improvise, but his trick definitely improves his overall performance.

  I think tricks are CONSOLIDATED EXPERIENCE. And our goal should be adding more tricks to a player's skill-set.

  Take W. Lei as an example. He is a very talented player who's very good at creating opportunities, but every pass he receives is like  brand new, he has to improvise on how to take the ball, and how to make the shot, and often that's how he loses the opportunity. What if he analyses all the similarities in the opportunities he creates, work out a set of four or five skills to tackle most of them, and improvise on the rest? That should largely increase his efficiency.

  Having more tricks also benefits team play.

  In a game, we want our players to think, and in SIPG they think a lot. But I believe most of the thinking should be devoted to reading the game, rather than making individual skill choices. The more tricks our players have, the less they will need to think about how to break, cut inside, pass and shoot, the more they can think about tactical decisions like where to run and whether to pass.

  Hulk probably came up with his tricks himself, but that doesn't always have to the case. Our players don't have enough experiences, which is why we should lend them more brain power to consolidate experiences, and form their own tricks.

  When a player reaches a certain age, forming tricks should be a necessity. I don't see why F. Huan can't break most defenders one on one, or why L. Chuangyi can't dribble like Isco(maybe at a lower level). We all know that Arjen Robben can cut inside like magic, why don't we have our players learn that? Imagine the star W. Lei could be if he can perform better cut inside.

  This is where 'football is a type of education' comes in. Our players are in good physical condition, they should be able to perform some of these tricks, all they need is a group of good teachers. I believe this is what Ricardo Carvalho is to our players, a good teacher. So why stop there? We like Robben's cut inside, Buffon's experience, and Ibrahimovic's shots, why not invite them to our club for a couple of days, and share their experience in a few tutorials, their tricks can be our players' tricks.

  Anyway, just a sincere piece of opinion.
