  As good as Wang Dalai is (he is seriously good!), I believe Zeng Cheng will still be #1 and it will be solidified after the Asian Champions League win and domination of domesticl league. Don't get me wrong, I see them as Casillas & Valdes. Both VERY good but I don't see Zeng losing his spot anytime soon...

  Not saying I am right.. just my 2 cents.
