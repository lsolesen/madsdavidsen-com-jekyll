  Hi Everyone, 
  I feel that l must be the only coach in football who doesn't understand attacking side of football who has been in professional football game more than 30 years .
  After so many years in the football business, l still do not get it this tactical cleverness of some genius coaches.
  Yes, The Teams are work on so many different patterns of play, every day of the week to be able to get right habits which most difficult things to changes in humans life. Good habits will create positive atmosphere on the football pitches for the football teams.
  But the reality is whenever the team has the football what to do with is depends on the players touches, decisions and executions on the day and their mental and psychical preparations on the week which going to effects the results, it is not the shape of the team or complicated numbers.
  Otherwise every the teams will play same games every week, that is the reason football is a magic and a beautiful game which is out of many teams sports the football is the only team game played by the feet.
  Of course , the players has to know some basic of fundamental understanding and movements of game but as a coaches we do asked the players '' play simple as possible '' than we do complicate the beautiful game with numbers.
  that is what l do not get it !! why do we need to complicate the game so much with numbers and figures.
  I watched and involved many games, there no way that l will never see an attacking game with a team does plays 4-4-2 , 4-3-3 , 4-2-3-1 or so.
  I believe that all the numbers are created by the coaches for the translation and defending period of the game.
  I do believe that coming back the shape or the systems is very importance for the player to use, when or if you do lose the ball, how quicker the team can gain the ball back.
  Rest is a story which created by the some too, too Clever Coaches.
  Shame that I am not that clever.

  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.........
  Thanks.
