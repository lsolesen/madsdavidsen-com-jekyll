On May 26-27th, I'm invited as a panel speaker to the football seminar / summit 2016 in Shanghai, where I will go as representant from my club Shanghai SIPG F.C. I really look forward to share my insights after working 4 years in Chinese football already.

We will discuss the future of Chinese football among other interesting topics & a lot of domestic and foreign clubs, coaches and media will join the seminar as well.
