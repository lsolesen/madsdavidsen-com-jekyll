I had a talk & interview recently with media **_Forbes_** on how football as an industry can create better & more sustainable club models. 

This is a huge issue in football since 75% of all clubs still use what we at Optima Football define as '_The unhealthy model_' where a head coach decide the strategy of the club and are sacked/changed within 18 months. And then the club strategy change again.

After this _Covid 19 crisis_ - it's more relevant than even before to create more sustainable models in the world of football.

**The interview can be found down below:**
