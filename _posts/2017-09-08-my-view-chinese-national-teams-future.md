China almost grabbed a sensational play-off spot this past week when the World Cup Asian Qualification to Russia 2018 ended. But the start of the campaign with only 1 point in 4 games became too much "heavy weight" - even for a top coach like Marcello Lippi to carry and bring China free off.

During my time in China, I know Marcello very well and I have had the pleasure to discuss football and observe his training sessions - also with the national team recently. And in my opinion; he is still the perfect coach to lead China into the near future.

I did an interview with _South China Morning Post_ regarding the future of the Chinese national team, which can be found below:
