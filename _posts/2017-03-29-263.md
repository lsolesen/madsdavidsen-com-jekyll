I've for the past 3 years been working in a field study turning into a book-project together with the Danish reasearcher and presenter, Helle Hedegaard Hein, and finally today, we have fully edited the final edition of the book.

The book will publishes around the start of June - only in Denmark and only in Danish language - with the tittle **"Når Talent Forpligter"**.

The main theme of the book is motivation and leadership through the right type motivation of top athletes and the next generation of talents.
