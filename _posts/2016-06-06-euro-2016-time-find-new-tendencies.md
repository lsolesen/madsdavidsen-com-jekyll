This week is the official kick off & start of the EURO 2016 in France. I'm as always looking forward to a lot of good football and interesting games coming up to add another dimension to the hot Chinese summer ongoing as we speak.

As I normally do during a big campaign; I will write _tactical analysis on a weekly basis_ during the tournament because I as a coach are massive interested in finding the 'new tendencies' and statistical evolvement, so a tournament like the EURO's is for me like going back to school and search for new inspiration and football related discussions.

I'm excited! Let's roll!
