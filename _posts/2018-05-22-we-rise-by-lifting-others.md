As a major part of my passion for developing people, teams and concepts, I have done several key note speeches the last 5 years.

I always aim to give something 'extra and unique' to the companies and people hiring me as I enjoy to lift and inspire others.

Feedback is crucial to keep improving and learning through failing - and I always welcome their view on me and my performance. At my latest speech, the feedback was mostly positive - a real privilege if I managed to inspire others.

**Professor & Director Sascha L. Schmidt - Center of Sports Management at WHU: **"Mads has been among the most inspiring speakers at SPOAC. His speeches are top notch - qualitatively as well as energetically. It is always a real pleasure to listen to himâ€œ.

As American Robert G. Ingersoll said: "_We rise by lifting others_".
