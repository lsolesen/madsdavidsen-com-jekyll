I'm very proud and happy to annouce that my future now is in place. I have signed a 2-year deal with the upcoming club in China, Shanghai SIPG. I will continue working for Sven Goran Eriksson as he will be the head coach of the new club, so it's a big honour for me to follow Sven once more after our success in Guangzhou R&F.

Down below are two articles (one in English and one in Danish) about the new deal:
