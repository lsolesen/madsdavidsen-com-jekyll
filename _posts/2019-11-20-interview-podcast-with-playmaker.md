These recent weeks, I have done a column and lately a podcast with the media _Playmaker_. The column regarding the understanding of _talent - born or developed_?

And a podcast in association with the Danish head coach of Brentford FC, Thomas Frank, on the modern role of a head coach in football.

At Optima Football, I (obviously) work to make the role and responsibility limited for a head coach, but at the same time increase the head coach' chances of staying in the job since there will be a clear understanding and alignment to the strategy and project from the beginning.

Both pieces can be found in the links below (in Danish):
