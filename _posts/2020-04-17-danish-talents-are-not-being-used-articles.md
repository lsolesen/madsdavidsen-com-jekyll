In recent weeks Danish football magazine, _Tipsbladet, made_ an interesting analysis on how many minutes home grown players are given in the Danish Super League. From 2014 until today.

The number decreased (almost) year by year and are down to 18%, which for me are way too low. The Super League should be a development league where young talents can play trying to reach the next level in Europe.

I did a couple of interviews with _Tipsbladet _on this subject which can be found in the links below (in Danish):
