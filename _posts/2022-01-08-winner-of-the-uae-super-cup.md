It is always a privilege to be part of a journey where you can help a club forward and add to its history. On January 7th 2022, we won the UAE Super Cup, and this was the first Super Cup win **ever** in the history of the club.

Al Jazira Club was founded 47 years ago and had until now never won this trophy, so a real mark for us to give back to the fans, stakeholders, board, etc.

Furthermore, we maintain our club strategy and had a total of 7 home grown players involved in the final. A number and percentage, we are very proud of.

Congratulations to everyone involved at Al Jazira Club!
