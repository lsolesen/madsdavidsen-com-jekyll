Different types of crisis will occur from time to time. The current one makes football not important at all, but as an industry we still have to prepare for the 'new normal' - on the other side.

Great minds through history have as well contributed to a proactive mindset during a crisis:

Winston Churchill used his quote ("_Don't waste of good crisis_") back during the WW2 and Rahm Emanuel - working for the Obama-government - has said:

"_You never let a serious crisis go to waste. And what I mean by that it's an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before_".

So even in difficult times we need to plan ahead, evaluate and execute proactively.
