I have today informed the president of Shanghai SIPG F.C. that I don’t wish to renew my contract and therefore will be leaving the club when my current contract expires at the end of the year – 31st of December 2018.

Obviously a very difficult decision made during the last 6 months. My final conclusion is that I need to continue progressing football wise and challenge myself leadership wise by moving on in my career after 4 amazing years with Shanghai SIPG.

It has been an honor to work with SIPG since the end of 2014 helping a new-founded club to rise – on and off the pitch. I have enjoyed my time together with proactive people creating our strategy and club-philosophy ‘THE SIPG WAY’ as well as working on the pitch with our players and coaches – from the 1st Team to the academy - implementing various aspects from the vision to the methodology.

I’m proud of how much we have progressed as a club within a relatively short period and I’m sure the future looks bright and positive for SIPG.

A heartfelt thank you goes to our president, CEO, GM & the entire management group for the cooperation and trust throughout the years. I will keep following the club with great interest in the future.

I’m now looking forward to finishing my work with the club as well as finding the next project for my career and in life in general.
