As part of the vision to explore, challenge and develop the world of football, five ambitious people will be given an internal education and foundation to help build the sustainable football clubs of the future.

**Founder and owner of Optima Football, Mads Davidsen:**

“I’m very pleased welcoming these ambitious young men who will provide further insights and new development to our sustainable model. It’s important we keep challenging and developing our concept from a scientific perspective to help football clubs grow strategically into the future.

Also at a personal level, it’s a privilege to be able to give something back to others by helping them find the right direction career wise and hopefully help them fulfil their potential.

One of the characteristics of my own motivation-archetype is the satisfaction of helping others succeed which makes it an even bigger pleasure having this new team enriching Optima Football".

The five newcomers at Optima Football are: Simon Jensen, Jacob Svarrer, Adam Føns, Mathias Damgaard and Mickey Ølholm.

Optima Football is a consultant-company helping professional football clubs develop in a sustainable way with strategic planning and coaching.

The concept brings club strategies to life and makes the road to long-lasting success transparent and obtainable for the whole club. As we speak, Optima Football is operating on three different continents worldwide.

Optima Football Consulting was established in January 2019, is based in London and managed by the owner, Mads Davidsen - a Danish UEFA PRO-Licensed Football Coach with vast experience in developing clubs, strategies, and talent. He holds a Master in Journalism and History and a mini MBA in Management and Leadership.
