Our season in China is now finished, and we can be satisfied reaching our goal with silver (number 2) and qualification to the Asian Champions League in 2016. This has all the time been our main target for this first season at Shanghai SIPG F.C., so we and the management are very pleased with the results this year.

We even competed for the Chinese championship all the way and had the chance in the last round to win the tittle, but needed Guangzhou Evergrande to loose, which they didn't, but still it was a positive signal for us being part of the battle all the way to the end.

Now, we look forward to 2016 and the preparations has already started trying to plan, recruit og organize further development for the team and the players plus how we not only take the next step, but also are able to compete in three competitions next year; the CSL, the Champions League & the Chinese FA Cup at the same time. This will be the most difficult task in 2016, but also a very interesting journey and a good step personally in my career as well.
