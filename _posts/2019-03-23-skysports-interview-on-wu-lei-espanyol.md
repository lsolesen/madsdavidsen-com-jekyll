The first Chinese player to score in a Top 5-league in the past 11 years, Wu Lei, is now a very popular figure - not only in Spain at his club RCD Espanyol - but globally as the potential of having a Chinese player now is obvious for the world of football.

I've been privileged to know Wu Lei for many years now as well as working with him the last 4 seasons at Shanghai SIPG F.C.

And last week, I went to Barcelona to visit and support him, and It was great to see a happy and humble player very exited about his chance in La Liga.

Skysports contacted me later on for an interview on Wu Lei and the interview can be found in the link below:
