**Welcome to Optima Football Academy**

This paper (link below) is the first product of our 'collaborative lab'. In this analysis known institutional theory is applied to the world of football to present a new perspective on how the game evolves.

By putting bright young minds to the task of identifying their respective fields I hope that we, the footballing world, can learn from their academic expertise whilst teaching them the unique ways of managing, coaching and directing in professional football, thus creating new talent to better the game for which we share the love. 

We wish to challenge and invite the world of professional football to participate in developing and debating this beautiful game on principles from science and knowledge, beneficiary to the clubs, the organisations, and spectators alike.

Please enjoy our paper:
