I contributed to this interesting article from _The Athletic_ by _Dermot Corrigan_ about RCD Espanyol, the Chinese link & Wu Lei as a brand of their organization and club towards the Asian market.

A Spanish club and case, I know well since one of my last tasks at Shanghai SIPG FC was to help find the right club for our star player, Wu Lei, moving to Europe in the end of 2018.
