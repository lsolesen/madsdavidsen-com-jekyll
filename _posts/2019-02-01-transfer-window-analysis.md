The January 2019 transfer window has now closed through out most of Europe and there are a few interesting elements to analyse:

\- This 2019-window was more quiet than the previous ones (all previous windows have been increasing since 2011); in relation to the number of deals and in terms of the actual spending. For example in the league traditionally spending the most, Premier League, are down 70% compared to the January 2018-window

\- Loan deals are increasing and the big European clubs still use the model of buying younger players, loan them out immediately for at a later stage win a profit when selling them again

\- The Chinese market has been significantly quiet and only 4 foreign transfer deals has been confirmed so far in the CSL (window close at February 28). It seems to be the tax regulation effect has 'killed' the interest of investing in foreign players

\- An interesting step in this window comes from the US and MLS as they now are a top 5-country in terms of selling players which can be a new model for the MLS-clubs and a way for them future wise to be a bigger part of the global football industry

\- Tottenham wrote history as they became the first club in the Premier League not buying one single player in the two transfer windows during a season. It is obviously very rare and almost presented like a sensation in the media, but it should instead be seen as a club maintaining their strategy not taking any last minute panic decisions. In other words; a club in control.
