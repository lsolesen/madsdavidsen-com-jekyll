I’m excited to announce the next journey in my career as I have joined the very proactive, forward thinking organisation ‘Right to Dream’ (RTD) as Group Head of Football.

I will help design and oversee a global football strategy aligning the RTD-units across Ghana, Denmark, Egypt and USA. To create opportunities and shape environments for young people, upcoming generations across the globe build huge motivation in me and I can’t wait getting started - which I already am - currently sitting in our academy in Cairo, Egypt: Everyone has the ‘Right To Dream’.
