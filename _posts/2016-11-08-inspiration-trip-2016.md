As we speak; I'm in London attending the LEADERS Sport Performance Summit. It's a 2-day course for CEO's, leaders and coaches and as always very inspiring + many interesting people here to add to your network.

It's part of my Inspiration-2016-trip. As usual in our off-season I travel around the World to meet clubs, coaches, network to gain new knowledge and bring back to my club as well.

I have already been visiting Manchester City and will in the coming 3 weeks be in Belgium, France, Spain & Italy, so a tough, but also very interesting schedule is ahead of me.
