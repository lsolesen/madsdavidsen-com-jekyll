- It has been a very difficult decision, because I really like my job and life in China, but I have decided not to extend my contract with Ebbe Sand Soccer Academy Shanghai, which will expire in a few weeks. I want to thank Mr. Ebbe Sand and the rest of the ESSA team for a great cooperation, team work, and a professional attitude during the past year. It has been a privilege to be a part of this exciting project.



- The Academy is now built up with around 80 players, the training and academy philosophy are implemented, the finances are secured, and therefore Iâ€™m glad to leave and let a new person come in and continue the solid work, we have done since 2012.



- Regarding my future, then I have two options, as we speak. One offer in China Mainland and one abroad, so I will analyze these opportunities and make a decision in the near future. The next step is very important for my professional football coaching career, so I need the time to find the right job and place.
