This past week, I was invited to the south of China by the Danish embassy in China as of the official 'Denmark Day' took place on September 26th.

Obviously, the main purpose and event was a royal visit from the Crown Prince and future King of Denmark - his Highness Crown Prince Frederik.

I was a big honor to meet our Crown Prince, discuss my role and life in China, how to export and promote Danish know-how & then hand the Crown Prince a Shanghai SIPG F.C. club shirt from our Brazilian top player, Hulk.

For me personally, it was important to participate and to show what a small country like Denmark can do and how we with knowledge and know-how can contribute to other countries and their growth as well.
