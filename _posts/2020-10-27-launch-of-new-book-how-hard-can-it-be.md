In one month (November 25th), my new book (in Danish) 'Hvor svært kan det være'? (How hard can it be?) will be launched in Denmark.

It is a book on strategies in football and how to develop a sustainable club in 2020 both on and off the pitch. About a biased and undeveloped world of football and how emotions often goes ahead of analytic preparations.

The process of the book has been for almost one year in cooperation with the former CEO of FC Copenhagen, Dan Hammer, who is co-author.

We are excited to publish this book as it is a theme not covered deeply previously and for us absolutely crucial if you wish to create continuously success in football.

**The book can be ordered at this link below:**
