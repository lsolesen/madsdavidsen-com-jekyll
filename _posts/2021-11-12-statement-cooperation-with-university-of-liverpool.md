A proud moment as our book '_How hard can it be?_' now officially is part of the curriculum at the _University of Liverpool _&_ University of Liverpool Management School_ and their MBA-program.

This gives our book another level of credibility in our beloved industry and both Dan Hammer and myself are proud to contribute to the development of football on and off the pitch.

'_How hard can it be?_' can be bought online as an e-book: <https://www.howhardcanitbebook.com/>
