The Chinese football season ended on November 3rd with a 3-1 win at Jiangsu, and we are generally extremely satisfied with our results and performances reaching the club goal of a top 3 league positon and qualification for the Asian Champions League next season.

I'm now on holiday and will travel a bit around China before leaving for Europe, where I will spent some time visiting clubs, getting new inspiration and network. I also have a very interesting trip to Beijing on November 14th, where I will give a speech about my life in China, my view on Chinese football and the future out here as well.

My own future are not official yet as my contract at Guangzhou R&F is ending now, and I'm still not in place with a new deal. I will update on my future as soon as possible!
