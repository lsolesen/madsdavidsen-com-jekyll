A very proud moment for us all at **Al Jazira Club** this week when we secured the league title of the Arabian Gulf League 2020/2021-season.

The third league title since the club's foundation back in 1974, so not an everyday moment for the club.

We are also very proud of our vision, strategy and pathway being succesful in a _sustainable way_ - <https://www.arabnews.com/node/1858221/sport>
