This past week, I had the pleasure to join and speak at a webinar arranged by the Icelandic Coaching Association. 

The theme was 'football strategies' and the importance of building up a sustainable model at a club or federation looking into a defined club or federation model and philosophy analysing the performances over time rather than the (obvious) short-term results.

The webinar is now (free) online at Youtube in the link below (in English):
