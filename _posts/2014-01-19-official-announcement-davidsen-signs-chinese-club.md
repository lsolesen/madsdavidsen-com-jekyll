I'm very happy to announce that I now officially have signed a 1-year contract with the professional Chinese club Guangzhou R&F F.C. The contract was mutual agreed back in December, but now officially signed and done.

I will work as an assistant coach, match analyzer, and scout for the club under the famous head coach Sven GÃ¶ran Eriksson (former England national head coach, Benfica, Lazio, Sampdoria, etc.). I will assist Sven on the pitch at the daily training, help him prepare matches, looking at opponents and find new players domestically and abroad to help improve the team and develop the club.

Furthermore, I will be involved in the new Academy of the club which is opened recently together with English giants Chelsea F.C.

It's a huge step in my coaching career, and I really look forward to a busy year with a massive load of work and great development for me personally and the club as well.
