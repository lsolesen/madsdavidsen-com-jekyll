In October 2020 our new book "Hvor svært kan det være?" ("How hard can it be"?) will be published - in the beginning only in Denmark as well in Danish.

This week my co-author, Dan Hammer and myself, joined in on a Danish podcast at _Mediano Media_ discussing strategies in football - in particular the advantages of having a strategy based on developing talents (home grown players) as many Danish clubs rely heavily on.

You can find the podcast online in the link below:
