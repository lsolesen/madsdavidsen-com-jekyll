The Danish radio station **P1** had a story about the new focus on football in China, and I was interviewed to give my view on the growing sport out here & the possibilites for football in China and Asian region in the future.

You can hear the interview online down below - just click on the link and choose '**Elitefodboldskoler i Kina**' in the menu on the right to listen to only my interview.
