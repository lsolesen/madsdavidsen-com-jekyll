I am very proud to announce that I from now on will write one column a week for the famous Chinese media; hupu.com. I was contacted by Hupu and after some good talks we decided to make a deal. My focus will of course be Chinese football and my view on the development and the CSL tournament as a foreign professional coach based in China Mainland.



The deal makes me the first foreign football writter in the country, so I am very humble and hope to provide the entusiatic Chinese football fans some interesting columns and comments. It's a great honour to join the battle to increase the standards in Chinese football on and now off the pitch. Together we move ahead!
