Today, we (ex FC Copenhagen-CEO, Dan Hammer and I) are excited and proud to announce the official launch of our new book "_**Hvor svært kan det være**_?" ("_How hard can it be_?") coming in October.

The book theme is football strategies - how a club can fulfil its potential both on and off the pitch - over time. How to develop something sustainable in a short-term thinking and emotional-decision-making based industry. 

To begin with the book will be published only in Danish, but we hope to move further into other countries and languages as well.

The book can be pre-ordered from today at our publisher _Dafolo_: <https://dafolo.dk/nyheder/hvor-svaert-kan-det-vaere.aspx>
