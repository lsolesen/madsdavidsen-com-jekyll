A few weeks ago, I handed in my resignation to the board of Al Jazira Club. It has been two very interesting and challenging years where we described and designed a new strategy and sustainable model for the club.

It has been a big ‘WE’ as many people have been involved in the turn around setting up new strategic standards for a club in the Middle East.Today, Al Jazira Club, are in a healthy position with a clear strategy, a club alignment from 1. team to academy, a young talented squad with more than 60% being home grown players, a strong academy closer to an European level (international benchmark) as ever and a new training ground on its way.

So I consider my task as fulfilled, and I would like to thank the shareholders, the board/committees, Group CEO, colleagues, Marcel Keizer & staff and players for the cooperation and trust. WE brought Al Jazira back to the top winning the league in 2020/2021, winning the Super Cup in 2022 and a return to the AFC highest level, Champions League, in 2022 as well.

The future looks bright for Al Jazira Club if they keep following the road map and work strategically.
