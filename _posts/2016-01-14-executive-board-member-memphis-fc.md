A new football club has been started in Tennessee, USA by some very inspiring and proactive people, and therefore I was keen on joining the board of the club when I got a phone call from the Memphis F.C. owners asking me to help their new club.

My role will be as a technical advisor in terms of recruitment and other football on-the-pitch related decisions and hopefully once a year, I will fly to Memphis and visit the club.

I'm really looking forward to this adventure and hopefully my small contribution will be another step in the development of not only this club, but the entire football industry in the US.
