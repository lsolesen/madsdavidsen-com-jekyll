Today, I had the pleasure to do an interview with the Danish radio station P1. We talked about the development of football in Asia and China. I'm very pleased to be able to hand my knowledge from Asia to a respected radio station as P1.

You can hear the program here and read an off-spin article as well (in Danish):
