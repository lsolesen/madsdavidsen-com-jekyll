While enjoying my holiday from (mostly) sunny Denmark, it's an interesting period in our life leaving Al Jazira Club and the UAE.

We are free and can move where ever - whenever. The feeling of freedom and at the same time the privilege of having (job) options on different continents makes it a perfect time to reflect and thinking forward.

What is the good life (for us)?

What kind of life do you wish to live?

What sacrifices are you willing to make?

What's the **career - family** balance worth in the different ends?

What's the pro's and con's in the different options?

Where do you want your kids to grow up?

There are so many variables in play, but of course family comes first, so overall we have to reflect in the coming weeks and then make the plan for the next step in our life.
