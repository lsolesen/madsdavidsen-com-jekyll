I'm in a very busy period with a lot of travelling and match every week until the World Cup break. We had a solid start in the Chinese Super League with currently 8 points in the first 4 matches, so we are satisfied and in the top of league as planned.

For me personally, it's a very exciting time with work 12-15 hours every day as I'm on the pitch every day at our daily training(s), I'm doing the analysis of our opponent - often travelling to see them live -, I'm doing analysis and stats of our own team, I'm trying to upgrade our work and philosophy for a young U23-players and as well involved in our scouting where a new transfer window is coming up in July.

So tons of work, but also very interesting and developing trying to build a new club and optimize the setup and philosophy. I enjoy this international challenge - also due to the distances in China where we have to fly to every away game, spent at least one night there and train at the stadium before just like a Europe Cup game in Denmark, so a good experience and knowledge to get for a young coach like me.

As well working under head coach Sven GÃ¶ran Eriksson is a great experience for me. I can learn so much on the pitch, off the pitch and also off "off" the pitch in terms of how the football world can be cruel, none-logic, and "all the games in the game" from a coach, who has tried it all for the last 40 years.

  
**2014 goals:**  
It's no secret that I always work very structured with goal setting for myself and my teams. 2014 is a big year for me where my main goals are focus on:  
  
\- My job at Guangzhou R&F  
  
\- UEFA Pro-license course   
  
\- To develop my international network  
  
\- The launch of two "new" football development projects (together with experts)  
  
\- Continue the work on my notes (possible book)  
  
\- To optimize my use of Amisco (use of stats) and use of Tactx (use of 3D video training sessions) from UEFA training ground  
  
(_I have of course a very concrete plan under each headline, so I know exactly how, when, where, why and who to deal with to improve and reach my goal_)

  
**Future thoughts:**  
I have a 1-year contract with Guangzhou R&F, and I could see myself continue at the club if the development and perspectives are right for me and the club. In China they operate with short term deals, which is okay with me, but I could see myself stay here, help develop the club and achieve more and more responsibility.   
  
No matter what - I'm very happy to live abroad. I enjoy the challenge of working under different cultures and with new people, who have another back ground than me. I learn a lot about my own values and become not only better on the pitch, but also more complete as a person and human being.  
  
Furthermore, I enjoy developing my network, and I have meet some really interesting people from all over the World and had discussions about the civil war in South Africa to the weapon law in the United States and of course football related debates with coaches from everywhere, which is very inspiring and fascinating, so I hope to stay abroad some years, if I get the right opportunity.
