**Coming home:** Sometimes in life there are moments and situations where things are much bigger than yourself. Moments where a choice is not really a choice, but a necessary change. Where you don’t need much consideration as you know what to do - even there are other interesting options available. 

Due to a ‘family situation’ our current way of living abroad moving around the globe has to end. Luckily, we find a lot of meaning, value, and excitement in the new path which means returning to Denmark as a family (in the near future) after more than 10 years abroad! 

We will see you all out there!
