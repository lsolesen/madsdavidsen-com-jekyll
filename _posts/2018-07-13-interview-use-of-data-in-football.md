I have in the last 10 years or so worked with data trying to study and explore how to implement data efficiently in the World of football.

It's first of all not an easy task to find and use data efficiently, but also football as an industry are quite conservative and based on experiences rather than science.

Most coaches and leaders in football are former players, who know the game from the inside, but also can lack a more scientific and evidential approach to their work.

But data has slowly moved inside the pro clubs, and it's moving in the right direction, which I try to explain in this article with data expert international company KMD (in Danish):
