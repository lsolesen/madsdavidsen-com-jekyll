On Thursday, November 14th, I will attend the Tour of the Football Legends in China as the official head coach of the team. I'm flattered to be involved in this project as I know how much these famous legends can promote Chinese football in terms of creating interest and make the sport even more popular. So of course I will like to support this project arranged by HUPU to help develop the football in China and try to encourage small childred to play football.

We will play two games in Guangzhou on Friday 15th and Sunday 17th and one game in Shanghai on Tuesday 19th, so it will be some interesting days with fun, happy people and hopefully a lot of fans.

**The legend squad:**

Ian Walker  
Shaka Hislop  
Michel Salgado  
Marcel Desailly  
Lee Sharpe  
Lee Hendrie  
Paul McVeigh  
Andy Cole  
Stan Collymore  
Michael Owen  
Marcus Bent  
Paul Scholes
