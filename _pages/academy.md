OPTIMA FOOTBALL ACADEMY



The vision behind our academy is raise the scientific understanding and know-how in the world of football by giving a platform and a chance for young, ambitious people with a passion for football, but not necessarily with a player career or a famous CV to rely on.



We believe in diversity as an organizational strength and therefore we give young people with different backgrounds an opportunity to grow within the Optima Football concept.



The Optima Football Academy is to be seen as a lab, where we allow ourselves to test new ideas, analyze different areas of our beloved game and share the insights with the public, so we as well can aim for a more productive football debate with depth and knowledge as main principles.



We will publish 5-6 columns and articles during a year trying to show the clubs and club owners how they could approach their investment or how the industry in general are runned.
