Don't gamble - plan ahead as a club

Today many clubs rely on their head coach to decide on transfers in and out. This I call "The Unhealthy Model".

Obviously, a head coach will influence a clubs transfers and can help developing the style of play, but a club should always bear in mind that a head coach is hired to fulfill your club strategy â€“ not to change it.

Some thoughts before a transfer window:

- What are we buying for? An immediately effect or a potential effect? (potential or performance)
- Find underestimated value (underestimated leagues and football countries)
- Prepare 2-3 years ahead (squad planning)
- Open new markets, continents and countries through Optima Football
