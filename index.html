      title: "How hard can it be?"
      excerpt: "Most football fans have probably asked themselves this question (How hard can it be?) when they watch their team lose several games in a row, or when the club pays an excessive price for an ageing attacker, or when the club hands in another bleeding annual report. The answer is that it is extremely hard to run a football club. Football is complex, relational and brutally competitive on the field. And outside the field it is even more complicated. Unfortunately, many decision makers in football are emotionally biased by a range of stressors that challenge their sense of rationale and time. The logic consequence is that they over estimate in the short run and under-analyze in the long haul. A football strategic book to inspire the industry."

<h2>- Building sustainable club strategies</h2>

<h3>From the board room to the training ground</h3>
 
<p>Optima Football Consulting is a company helping professional football clubs develop in a sustainable way with strategic planning.</p>
<p>In latin, optima means the best obtainable result or in other words - fullfil a potential.</p>
<p>Successful companies like Apple or Carlsberg have long-term strategies to fulfill their succession planning. And they have core staff staying in their jobs for many years to maintain the strategy and continuity. This is one of the major keys to succeed in the long run.</p>
<p>A professional football club needs to implement sustainable strategies if it wants to be a serious competitor again - and again - and again.</p>
<p>Not only to keep winning matches and maintaining the ideal position (achieve the potential) for the club, but also to stop wasting money by sacking coaches and staff - and changing numerous players in the squad every season.</p>
<p>Our concept & model build club strategies and makes the road to long-lasting success transparent and obtainable for the entire club.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mads was one of the key factors to our club's growth and success from 2014-2018 from being a small local club to an internationally known club able to win titles - and competing in the Asian Champions League while playing with a majority of
home grown players. Mads worked intensively every day on improving our club from the first team to the academy and developed our club strategy 'The SIPG Way' which still is the foundation for our club.</p>
