    excerpt: >-
      Most football fans have probably asked themselves this question (How hard
      can it be?) when they watch their team lose several games in a row, or
      when the club pays an excessive price for an ageing attacker, or when the
      club hands in another bleeding annual report.

      The answer is that it is extremely hard to run a football club. Football
      is complex, relational and brutally competitive on the field. And outside
      the field it is even more complicated. Unfortunately, many decision makers
      in football are emotionally biased by a range of stressors that challenge
      their sense of rationale and time.

      The logic consequence is that they over estimate in the short run and
      under-analyze in the long haul. A football strategic book to inspire the
      industry.

      Bringing the club strategy all the way from the offices to the training
      pitch is a difficult step. The way many football clubs are run today is
      very unsustainable.
